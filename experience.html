<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
<article>
<p class="cent-para">I have worked in banking for the past 10 years. 
    Working across all areas Personal, Business Corporate & Commercial. Mainly I worked as a Relationship Manager
for small to medium size businesses. I was really good at this job but it wasnt what I wanted to do or what I enjoyed.
So I decided a career change was needed, and this is where my journey begins.</p>
